# Secure Storage: Stores sensitive data in an encrypted format within the Kubernetes cluster.
# Access Control: Can be restricted with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to limit access to authorized users and services.
# Multiple Usage: Can be injected as environment variables, volumes, or as part of a service account for pod authentication.
# Base64 Encoding: While secrets are base64-encoded, itâ€™s important to note that base64 is not encryption, so you should consider using encryption at rest for enhanced security.
