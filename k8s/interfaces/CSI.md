Container Storage Interface (CSI) in Kubernetes

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standardized API that allows Kubernetes to interact with various storage systems in a uniform way. Before CSI, Kubernetes relied on in-tree storage plugins, which required updating Kubernetes itself to add support for new storage providers. CSI decouples storage management from Kubernetes, enabling the use of external storage solutions without modifying the core Kubernetes code.

How CSI Works in Kubernetes

CSI introduces a plugin-based architecture that enables storage providers to develop their own CSI drivers. These drivers communicate with external storage systems, allowing Kubernetes to perform storage-related operations like:

    Provisioning — Creating new storage volumes dynamically.

    Attachment — Attaching storage volumes to specific Kubernetes nodes.

    Mounting — Making storage volumes available to containers.

    Snapshot & Cloning — Creating backups and replicas of storage volumes.

    Resizing & Deletion — Expanding or removing storage volumes when no longer needed.

CSI Components

A CSI-based storage solution typically consists of:

    CSI Driver — The implementation provided by storage vendors (e.g., AWS EBS CSI driver, Azure Disk CSI driver).

    CSI Controller Plugin — Manages volume provisioning, attachment, and snapshots.

    CSI Node Plugin — Runs on each Kubernetes node and handles volume mounting and unmounting.

    External Provisioner — Creates persistent volumes dynamically based on storage class settings.

Capabilities of CSI

    Dynamic Volume Provisioning — Storage is allocated on demand, eliminating the need for pre-provisioned volumes.

    Volume Expansion — Supports resizing persistent volumes without downtime.

    Volume Snapshots & Cloning — Enables backups and restores of storage.

    ReadWriteMany (RWX) Support — Allows multiple pods to share the same volume.

    Customizability — Different storage backends can implement advanced features like encryption, caching, and replication.

Example: Checking CSI Health

To check if CSI is functioning correctly, you can use the following Kubernetes commands:

List Installed CSI Drivers

```
kubectl get csidrivers
```

This lists all CSI drivers installed on the cluster.

Check Storage Classes Managed by CSI

```
kubectl get storageclass
```

This displays available storage classes that use CSI drivers.

List Persistent Volumes (PVs) Created via CSI

```
kubectl get pv
```

This shows all persistent volumes provisioned by CSI.
Real-World Usage of CSI in Kubernetes

    Monitoring volume health using Kubernetes events and logs.

    Configuring snapshots for disaster recovery using CSI volume snapshot capabilities.

    Testing volume expansion to ensure persistent volumes could scale as needed.

    Migrating from in-tree EBS to CSI-based EBS drivers to align with Kubernetes best practices.


Example: YAML Configuration for CSI Storage in Kubernetes

Define a Storage Class Using CSI (AWS EBS Example)

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-csi
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  encrypted: "true"
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

    This storage class dynamically provisions AWS EBS volumes using the EBS CSI driver.

Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Using CSI

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs-csi
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

    This PVC requests a 10GiB volume from the ebs-csi storage class.

Use the PVC in a Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: csi-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/data"
          name: storage
  volumes:
    - name: storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: ebs-pvc
```

    The pod mounts the 10GiB CSI-backed volume at /data.
